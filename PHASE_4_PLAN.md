# Phase 4: Lifetime Views — Concept Lock

## 1. Purpose of Lifetime Views

After five years of reflections, a user should see themselves as a continuous thread rather than isolated moments. The view reveals persistent identity patterns, long-running themes, and how their thinking has evolved across years without forcing conclusions or comparisons.

The emotional outcome is recognition: "I can see who I've been becoming." Not judgment, not optimization, not comparison to others—just clear recognition of one's own arc. The view should feel like reading chapters of your own story, where each year adds context but doesn't invalidate what came before.

## 2. Questions this view is allowed to answer

• What themes have persisted across multiple years?

• How did my focus shift between different periods?

• What questions or concerns appeared consistently?

• Which years marked significant changes in how I think?

• What patterns connect my earliest reflections to my most recent ones?

• How did my relationship with certain topics evolve over time?

• What remained constant even as other things changed?

## 3. Questions this view must never answer

• What should I focus on next? (No prescriptions)

• Am I improving or getting worse? (No scoring or optimization)

• What will happen in the future? (No predictions)

• How do I compare to others? (No external benchmarks)

• What's the right way to reflect? (No should statements)

• Which year was best or worst? (No ranking or judgment)

• What metrics show I'm on track? (No analytics or KPIs)

## 4. Tempo and tone

Slow. Reflective. Like reading old journals on a quiet afternoon, not analyzing a dashboard. The view should invite pause, not action. It should feel like observing your own evolution from a distance—like watching time-lapse footage of a tree growing, where you can see the shape emerge without needing to measure each branch.

The tone is narrative-first, meaning-first. It reads like chapters, not reports. It uses language that feels like reflection, not analysis. It positions the user as an observer of their own story, not a participant being evaluated.

## 5. Relationship to other views

Weekly Insights show immediate patterns and recent activity—they answer "What's happening now?" Yearly Wrap captures a single year's shape and meaning—it answers "What was this year about?" Share Packs extract shareable moments for external expression—they answer "What can I show others?"

Lifetime Views answer "Who have I been becoming?" They connect years into a continuous arc, revealing identity threads that span multiple years. Unlike Weekly Insights (immediate), Yearly Wrap (annual), or Share Packs (momentary), Lifetime Views show the long arc—the themes and patterns that persist across years, the questions that recur, and the ways thinking evolves without forcing conclusions about whether that evolution is good or bad.
