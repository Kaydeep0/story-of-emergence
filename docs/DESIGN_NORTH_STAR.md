# Story of Emergence — Design North Star

## What This Is

This document defines the **experiential truth** of Story of Emergence.

It is not a UI spec.
It is not a feature list.
It is not aesthetic guidance.

It is the **cognitive and sensory contract** the system must honor.

If a design decision conflicts with this document, the design decision is wrong.

## Core Truth

Story of Emergence is not an app.

It is a **cognitive vessel**.

A private space where:
- Memory is stored like matter
- Insight behaves like gravity
- Time is navigable
- The self is both pilot and observer

Users do not "use" this system.
They **enter** it.

---

## Primary Metaphor (Structural, Not Aesthetic)

The system should feel like navigating **inside one's own mind via a spaceship**.

This metaphor is structural:
- Cockpit, not dashboard
- Navigation, not browsing
- Instruments, not widgets
- Signals, not notifications

Any UI that feels like a feed, task list, or productivity tool is misaligned.

---

## Core Flow (Mental, Not Click-Based)

The correct experiential sequence is:

**Drift → Detect → Zoom → Reflect → Emerge**

Not:
Click → View → Card → Export

Interfaces must support slowing down, not accelerating action.

---

## Three Layer Model

### 1. The Void (Default State)

- Quiet
- Dark
- Minimal
- No demand

The Void communicates:
"You are here. Your mind is loaded."

No metrics.
No calls to action.
Silence is intentional.

---

### 2. Signals (What the System Notices)

- Subtle pulses
- Spikes
- Anomalies
- Patterns forming

Insights should **appear**, not announce themselves.

They are objects in space, not cards in a list.

---

### 3. Lenses (How You Look)

- Weekly
- Yearly
- Lifetime

Lenses are **modes**, not pages.

The data does not change.
The gravity does.

Switching lenses should feel like changing instruments, not navigation.

---

## Design Tone Principles

- Darkness represents trust, not emptiness
- Information is revealed through focus, not density
- Motion implies thought, not productivity
- Silence is a feature
- Space does real work

If the interface feels loud, busy, or demanding, it is wrong.

---

## Navigation Philosophy

Avoid:
- Dashboards
- Feeds
- Card grids
- Gamification
- Metrics-first layouts

Favor:
- Exploration
- Spatial hierarchy
- Progressive reveal
- Intent-driven interaction

---

## Completion Criteria

The system is "finished" when:
- Entering it feels like entering your own head safely
- Navigation feels like exploration
- Insights feel discovered, not served
- Time feels dimensional
- Silence feels intentional

Feature completeness is secondary to experiential coherence.

---

## Design Permission (Explicit)

It is allowed — and expected — to pause feature work to align sensory truth.

Engine first.
Cockpit second.

This order is correct.

---

## Reminder

Messy does not mean wrong.
It means instrumentation is not yet complete.

Story of Emergence is built from the inside out.
