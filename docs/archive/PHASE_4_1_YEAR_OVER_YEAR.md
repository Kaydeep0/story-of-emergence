# Phase 4.1: Year over Year View — Concept Lock

## 1. Purpose

A user should understand how their thinking shifted between two specific years—not as improvement or decline, but as change itself. Within a single year, patterns can feel stable or random. Across two years side by side, the user can see what shifted, what remained, and what questions emerged or faded.

This view reveals contrast: "How did I think differently then versus now?" It shows evolution without requiring judgment about whether that evolution was good or bad. The user should be able to recognize their own change without being told what that change means.

## 2. Allowed questions

• How did my dominant themes differ between these two years?

• What questions or concerns appeared in one year but not the other?

• How did my language or focus shift between these periods?

• What remained constant across both years despite other changes?

• What new patterns emerged in the later year that weren't present earlier?

## 3. Forbidden questions

• Which year was better or more productive? (No ranking or judgment)

• Am I improving or getting worse? (No improvement scoring)

• What should I do differently next year? (No prescriptions or optimization)

• How do these years compare to others' years? (No external benchmarks)

• What metrics show progress? (No success narratives or KPIs)

• What will happen next year? (No predictions)

• Which year was more successful? (No success narratives)

## 4. Temporal framing

Time should feel like comparing two photographs taken years apart—you can see what changed and what stayed, but the distance between them is palpable. The view should create a sense of contrast and memory: "That was how I thought then, and this is how I think now."

The framing is comparative but not competitive. It's like looking at two chapters from different parts of the same book—you can see the narrative shift without needing to declare one chapter better than the other. The temporal distance should feel real but not overwhelming, creating enough separation to see change clearly without losing the sense of continuity.

## 5. Relationship to Lifetime View

Lifetime View shows the long arc across all years—the persistent themes and identity threads that span multiple years. Year over Year View zooms in to compare two specific years side by side, revealing the contrast and change between those periods.

Where Lifetime View answers "Who have I been becoming?" across the full timeline, Year over Year answers "How did I change between these two points?" Lifetime shows continuity; Year over Year shows contrast. Lifetime reveals what persisted; Year over Year reveals what shifted. They complement each other: Lifetime provides context for the long arc, while Year over Year provides clarity on specific transitions.
