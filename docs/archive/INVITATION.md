# Invitation Language

## The invitation use case

**Who is the inviter:** Someone who has been using this privately for reflection.

**Who is the invitee:** One specific person the inviter trusts.

**What moment prompts the invitation:** End of a year, when the inviter has completed a yearly summary and wants to share it with someone who might understand.

## The invitation line

I've been using something privately and thought you might find it interesting.

## Anti-scaling check

This sentence does not work at scale. It assumes a specific relationship between two people. It loses meaning if automated or sent to multiple recipients. It requires trust that has been built outside this system.

If this sentence appears in a mass email, a social media post, or a marketing campaign, it becomes false. The word "privately" becomes meaningless. The phrase "thought you might find it interesting" becomes performative.

This sentence only works when it is true: when one person has actually been using something privately, when they have actually thought about one specific person, and when that thought is genuine rather than strategic.
