# Insight Taxonomy

**Status:** Constraint document after Phase 21 stabilization  
**Date:** 2024  
**Purpose:** Explicit boundary definition for what insights Story of Emergence may and may not produce

---

## A. Allowed Insight Types

The system may produce insights that reveal observable structure without assigning meaning, direction, or value.

**Temporal patterns**
- Frequency of events over time
- Spacing between events
- Density variations
- Recurrence patterns
- No temporal narrative or progression framing

**Frequency changes**
- Increases or decreases in activity
- Shifts in reflection frequency
- Variation in engagement patterns
- No directional interpretation (no "improving" or "declining")

**Density shifts**
- Concentration of activity in specific periods
- Clustering of events
- Distribution of activity across time
- No value assignment to density levels

**Co-occurrence clusters**
- Themes that appear together
- Structural relationships between reflections
- Patterns of association
- No ranking or importance assignment

**Distribution shape changes**
- Statistical patterns (normal, log-normal, power-law)
- Variance in activity distribution
- Tail weight and skewness
- No optimization signals based on shape

**Absence and silence**
- Periods without activity
- Fading themes
- Missing patterns
- No judgment about absence (no "should have" or "missing")

**Structural observations**
- Word frequency shifts
- Topic emergence and disappearance
- Conceptual distance between themes
- No semantic interpretation or meaning assignment

## B. Explicitly Forbidden Insight Types

The system must never produce insights that imply agency, direction, value, or behavioral guidance.

**Advice**
- No suggestions for action
- No "you should" or "try this" language
- No recommendations for behavior change

**Recommendations**
- No "best practices" or "optimal" patterns
- No suggestions for improvement
- No guidance on how to use the system

**Goals**
- No goal-setting language
- No "aim for" or "target" framing
- No achievement-oriented language

**Scores**
- No numerical ratings or scores
- No quality assessments
- No performance metrics

**Rankings**
- No "most important" or "top" insights
- No hierarchical ordering by value
- No "best" or "worst" comparisons

**Predictions**
- No forecasts of future behavior
- No "will likely" or "tends to" projections
- No forward-looking statements

**Optimization signals**
- No "could be better" language
- No efficiency suggestions
- No performance improvement hints

**Behavioral reinforcement**
- No encouragement to continue patterns
- No discouragement of patterns
- No reinforcement of specific behaviors

**Progress indicators**
- No "you're making progress" language
- No growth or development framing
- No improvement or decline narratives

**Coaching language**
- No "keep going" or "maintain" suggestions
- No motivational language
- No habit-building language

## C. Interpretation Boundary

**Insight reveals structure. Meaning is constructed by the observer. Action belongs outside the system.**

The system computes and displays observable patterns from encrypted reflection data. These patterns are structural facts: frequencies, distributions, co-occurrences, temporal arrangements. The system does not interpret these patterns, assign them significance, or suggest responses.

All meaning, significance, and value arise from the human observer's interpretation of the displayed structure. The observer alone determines what patterns matter, what they signify, and what (if any) action to take.

The system never crosses from observation into agency. It does not guide, recommend, optimize, or reinforce. It only reveals what structure exists in the data, leaving all interpretation and action to the observer.

## Enforcement

When adding new insight types:

1. **Ask:** Does this reveal structure or assign meaning?
   - ✅ Reveals structure → allowed
   - ❌ Assigns meaning → forbidden

2. **Ask:** Does this imply direction or value?
   - ✅ Neutral observation → allowed
   - ❌ Directional/value judgment → forbidden

3. **Ask:** Does this suggest action or behavior?
   - ✅ Passive observation → allowed
   - ❌ Action suggestion → forbidden

4. **Ask:** Does this adapt to user behavior?
   - ✅ Static computation → allowed
   - ❌ Adaptive response → forbidden

*This taxonomy serves as a constraint boundary. All insight generation must conform to these rules.*
