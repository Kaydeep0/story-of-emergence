# Phase 3 — Distribution of Meaning

**Status:** COMPLETE

## What exists:
- Share Pack renderer equals export output
- Copy caption, PNG download, Web Share API
- Quiet success, failure only
- Guardrails preventing accidental disclosure
- Session scoped confirmation
- Vault locked = sharing disabled
- Subtle watermark indicating intentional sharing

## What this phase is NOT:
- Social feed
- Growth loop
- Engagement engine
- Virality system

## Principle locked:
**Meaning is shared deliberately, never extracted.**

No new features will be added to Phase 3.
Future work happens in Phase 4 and beyond.
