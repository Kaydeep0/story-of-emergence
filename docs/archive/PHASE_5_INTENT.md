# Phase 5 — Lifetime Intelligence Intent

This document defines intent and limits before capability is added.
No implementation decisions are made here.

---

## 1. Questions a Lifetime View Should Answer (and why they matter)

Write in plain language.

- What patterns repeat across multiple years, even as circumstances change?
  - Helps recognize persistent themes that may be core to identity or values
  
- What themes disappear and never return?
  - Shows what was temporary versus what was foundational
  
- What behaviors persist despite conscious attempts to change?
  - Reveals structural patterns that may be invisible in day-to-day reflection
  
- How do the same words or concepts appear differently across years?
  - Allows observation of evolution without interpretation
  
- What time gaps exist between related reflections?
  - Shows rhythm and return cycles without judgment

---

## 2. Questions the System Must Never Answer

These are forbidden inferences.

- Why something happened (causation is interpretation)
- Whether a decision was good or bad (value judgments are user-owned)
- What a person "should" do next (advice violates agency)
- Psychological or emotional diagnoses (medical/clinical claims are forbidden)
- Whether someone has "improved" or "grown" (comparison implies direction)
- What patterns mean (meaning is user-authored only)
- Whether themes are "healthy" or "unhealthy" (no normative framing)
- Predictions about future behavior (inference beyond data)

---

## 3. What Must Always Remain User-Authored

These elements are never generated:

- Meaning of any pattern or theme
- Interpretation of why patterns exist
- Identity statements (e.g., "You are X" or "You tend to Y")
- Conclusions about self or others
- Emotional labels or sentiment analysis
- Value judgments or assessments
- Advice or recommendations
- Narrative summaries that compress reflection content

---

## 4. Acceptable Machine Roles (strictly bounded)

Examples:

- Counting occurrences across time periods
- Ordering by frequency, recency, or confidence
- Time-based grouping (by year, month, or custom ranges)
- Confidence signaling (structural support only)
- Provenance tracing (linking to source reflections)
- Gap detection (time spans between related reflections)
- Frequency measurement (how often something appears)
- Temporal sequencing (what came before/after)
- Pattern detection (repetition, not meaning)
- Structure exposure (revealing what exists, not what it means)

---

## 5. Red Lines (non-negotiable)

If crossed, Phase 5 must stop.

- Any hidden inference (all logic must be inspectable)
- Any summary that replaces original reflection (reflections remain primary)
- Any language implying truth, advice, or authority (system is observational only)
- Any emotional or psychological labeling (no clinical framing)
- Any comparison that implies improvement or decline (no directional judgment)
- Any generated text that sounds like interpretation (only structural facts)
- Any stored narrative that becomes source of truth (always derived)
- Any confidence score that implies importance (only structural support)
- Any pattern claim without explicit reflection links (provenance required)
- Any cross-year inference that creates meaning (only structural observation)

---

## 6. Success Definition for Phase 5

Phase 5 is successful if:

- The user feels *more aware*, not more directed
- Uncertainty is visible, not resolved
- The system never speaks louder than the data
- Patterns are exposed without interpretation
- User retains full ownership of meaning
- No reflection content is ever replaced or summarized
- All claims link back to source reflections
- Confidence always reflects structure, never importance
- The system feels like a quiet observer, not an advisor
- Users can inspect every claim's provenance
- No hidden logic or inference exists
- The lifetime view feels like discovery, not diagnosis
