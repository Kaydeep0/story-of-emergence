# Observer v1 First Capability Selection

**Status:** Decision document  
**Purpose:** Choose the first Observer v1 capability to implement

This document selects one capability from the Observer v1 allowed list. The choice sets the gravitational field for all subsequent Observer v1 work.

---

## 1. Candidate Capabilities

Three capabilities from the Observer v1 allowed list:

- **Pattern persistence across windows:** The same underlying pattern (e.g., "spike days cluster on weekends") can be recognized across Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly lenses. The pattern is the same; only the window changes.

- **Cross-lens continuity:** Patterns that appear in Weekly can be recognized when they recur in Yearly. The same pattern, witnessed across different time windows, without interpretation.

- **Temporal echoes:** When a pattern observed in one window appears again in a later window, Observer v1 can note the recurrence. Not as "this is good" or "this is bad," but as "this pattern repeated."

## 2. Choose One

**Selected:** Pattern persistence across windows

**Rationale:**

Pattern persistence is the most foundational capability. It requires only that Observer recognize the same pattern signature across different time windows, without any interpretation layer. Once this recognition exists, cross-lens continuity follows naturally (if a pattern persists across Weekly and Yearly, it is continuous across lenses). Temporal echoes follow naturally (if a pattern persists across windows, it has echoed across time). The other capabilities build on this foundation.

This choice does not distort stance because pattern persistence is pure recognition. Observer v1 does not interpret what the pattern means, only that it is the same pattern. The system witnesses the same signature in different windows. No ranking, no labeling, no interpretation. Just recognition: "This pattern appears here, and also here."

## 3. Definition of Done

Observer v1 pattern persistence is done when:

- A user notices a pattern they already recognized in a different lens
- The system shows the same pattern across Weekly and Yearly without explaining why
- Nothing asks the user to act on the pattern
- The pattern feels discovered, not delivered
- Ambiguity is preserved (the pattern can coexist with contradictory patterns)
- The mirror remains a mirror (recognition, not interpretation)
