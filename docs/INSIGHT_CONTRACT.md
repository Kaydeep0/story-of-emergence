# Insight Contract

**Non-negotiable definition:** An Insight is a falsifiable claim about the user's behavior or thinking, supported by evidence across time.

---

## Required Structure

Every insight must contain four components:

### 1. Claim
Something the user might already feel but isn't sure about.

**Not:** "You wrote 5 entries this week."  
**Yes:** "You don't process things gradually. You wait, then commit fully."

The claim must be about behavior or thinking patterns, not raw metrics.

---

### 2. Evidence
2–4 concrete metrics or observations.

**Required elements:**
- Dates (when patterns occurred)
- Counts (how many times)
- Deltas (changes over time)
- Absences (what didn't happen)

**Example:**
- 72% of reflections occur in 3-day clusters
- Median gap between clusters: 9 days
- No sustained low-level activity detected

---

### 3. Contrast
What didn't happen that could have.

**Purpose:** Makes the claim falsifiable by showing what alternative pattern was not observed.

**Example:** "A steady cadence pattern was not observed across any 30-day window."

---

### 4. Confidence Signal
Why the system is confident enough to say this now.

**Required:** Must reference the scope of evidence (time windows, sample size, pattern repetition).

**Example:** "Pattern repeats across weekly, monthly, and yearly windows."

---

## Validation Rule

**If an insight can't pass this test, it doesn't render.**

An insight that lacks any of these four components is not an insight—it's a summary or a metric.

---

## Example (Complete)

**Claim:** You don't process things gradually. You wait, then commit fully.

**Evidence:**
- 72% of reflections occur in 3-day clusters
- Median gap between clusters: 9 days
- No sustained low-level activity detected

**Contrast:** A steady cadence pattern was not observed across any 30-day window.

**Confidence:** Pattern repeats across weekly, monthly, and yearly windows.

## Implementation Notes

- Insights are claims, not descriptions
- Evidence must be concrete and verifiable
- Contrast makes claims falsifiable
- Confidence signals prevent premature conclusions
