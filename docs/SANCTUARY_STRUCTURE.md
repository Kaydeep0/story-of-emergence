# Sanctuary Structural Coherence

This document defines what surfaces are primary, what supports them, and how attention should flow through the vault.

## A. Primary Surfaces

The three surfaces a user should spend most of their time in:

**Reflections feed** — The main surface where thoughts are captured and reviewed. This is where writing happens and where the vault feels most alive.

**Single reflection view** — The focused view for reading and reflecting on individual entries. This is where depth happens, where a single thought can be fully considered.

**Insights lens (read-only)** — The narrative views that help understand patterns over time. This is where meaning emerges, where themes become visible without judgment.

If something is not essential to reflection, understanding, or meaning-making, it does not belong in the primary surfaces.

## B. Secondary Surfaces

Surfaces that support but should not dominate attention:

**Sources** — External references that inform reflections. Secondary because they are context, not the primary act of reflection itself.

**Sharing flows** — The process of creating shareable artifacts. Secondary because sharing is occasional and intentional, not the core activity.

**Settings** — Configuration and preferences. Secondary because the vault should work without configuration, and settings should be discoverable but not prominent.

**Shared content view** — Viewing content shared by others. Secondary because the vault is primarily personal, and shared content is supplementary.

**Vault health** — Status and encryption information. Secondary because it should be available but not distracting. The vault should feel secure without constant reminders.

## C. Entry Points

How a user should naturally enter the vault:

**Default landing surface:** Reflections feed. The user lands where they can immediately see their own thinking. This is home.

**First meaningful action:** Writing a reflection. The first thing the vault invites is thought capture, not navigation or exploration.

**What should never interrupt entry:**
- Onboarding flows
- Feature announcements
- Achievement notifications
- Prompts to complete profiles
- Suggestions to explore features
- Any call-to-action that isn't "write"

The vault should feel immediately familiar, even on first visit. Entry should be frictionless and calm.

## D. Exit Points

How a user leaves a session:

**What signals completion without reward:** The reflection is saved. The thought is captured. There is no "great job" or "you're doing well." Completion is simply the act of saving, nothing more.

**What confirms safety or closure:** The encryption status is visible but not prominent. The user knows their data is secure without being reminded constantly. Closure comes from the act itself, not from external validation.

**What should not appear at exit:**
- "Come back tomorrow" messages
- Streak reminders
- Achievement unlocks
- Social prompts
- Feature suggestions
- Any language that implies obligation or reward

**Guiding constraint:** Leaving should feel resolved, not addictive. The vault should feel complete when you're done, not like something you need to return to.

## E. Forbidden Structures

UI patterns that must never exist in the sanctuary:

**Infinite scroll without friction** — Scrolling should feel intentional, not endless. There should be natural stopping points, not infinite feeds that pull attention indefinitely.

**Global dashboards** — No single view that aggregates everything into metrics or summaries. The vault is not a command center. Information should be accessed through specific lenses, not a central hub.

**Achievement summaries** — No "you've written X reflections" or "your longest streak is Y days." Achievements are gamification, and gamification breaks sanctuary feeling.

**Feed ranking** — No algorithmic ordering of reflections. Chronological order only. The system never decides what you should see first based on engagement or importance.

**"You might also like"** — No suggestions based on patterns or similarity. No "people who wrote about X also wrote about Y." The vault shows what exists, not what it thinks you should see.

**Progress indicators** — No bars showing completion toward goals, no "you're 60% of the way there," no visual progress toward any target. Progress implies goals, and goals break sanctuary feeling.

**Notification centers** — No central place for alerts, reminders, or prompts. The vault never interrupts. Information is available when sought, not pushed.

## Structural Principles

These rules govern how surfaces relate:

1. **Primary surfaces are always accessible** — No more than one click away from any point in the vault.

2. **Secondary surfaces are discoverable but not prominent** — They exist, but they don't compete for attention.

3. **Entry is always to primary** — Users never land on secondary surfaces by default.

4. **Exit is always from primary** — Secondary surfaces don't trap attention or create exit friction.

5. **No duplication** — Information appears in one place only. If it exists in two places, one is redundant and should be removed.

6. **No nesting beyond two levels** — Primary → Detail is acceptable. Primary → Secondary → Tertiary is not. Complexity creates cognitive load.

7. **Navigation is minimal** — Fewer choices reduce decision fatigue. The vault should feel simple, not feature-rich.
