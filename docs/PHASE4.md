## Phase 4 — Distribution Engine (IN PROGRESS)

Purpose:
Transform private insights into controlled, time-aware outputs without leaking raw data.

Core idea:
Meaning compounds through time and recurrence, not volume.

Locked invariants:
- No raw plaintext leaves the client
- All distributions operate on derived artifacts only
- Time is a first-class axis
- Outputs are intentional, not automatic

Concepts:
- Time buckets (day, week, month, year)
- Distribution shapes:
  - Normal (routine insight)
  - Log-normal (learning bursts)
  - Power-law (identity-defining moments)
- Weight = recurrence × emotional signal × novelty

Outputs (future):
- Monthly digests
- Research briefs
- Shareable insight packs
- Personal learning syllabus
