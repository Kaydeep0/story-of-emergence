# Phase 12.1 — Mirror vs Lens Decision (Declaration Only)

**Status:** Final Declaration  
**Date:** 2024  
**No Code Changes:** This phase introduces no code and no features.

---

## 1. Role Selection

**DECLARED: Mirror**

The system reflects structure only.

**No guidance. No framing. No suggestions.**

### Rationale

The system is a passive mirror that observes and reports structural properties without interpretation, guidance, or intentional framing. The observer interprets meaning. The system does not.

---

## 2. Allowed Influence

**Answer: Awareness only.**

The system may present structural observations (density, gradient, curvature, emergence) and temporal patterns as properties of structure, without interpretation or meaning attribution.

The system may NOT influence reflection cadence, provide interpretation scaffolding, shape behavior, or create meaning.

**Boundary:** The system observes structure. The observer interprets meaning. The system never crosses this boundary.

---

## 3. Absolute Prohibitions

The system will **never** do the following, even if technically possible, helpful, or profitable:

1. **Never generate prompts or questions**
   - No "What if you reflected on X?"
   - No "Consider exploring Y"
   - No questions of any kind

2. **Never suggest reflection cadence**
   - No "You haven't reflected in a while"
   - No reminders, nudges, or encouragement
   - No timing suggestions

3. **Never provide interpretation frameworks**
   - No "This pattern suggests..."
   - No "You might be experiencing..."
   - No therapeutic, coaching, or guidance language

4. **Never optimize or improve**
   - No "To get better insights, try..."
   - No optimization suggestions of any kind

5. **Never create temporal narratives**
   - No "You've been..."
   - No "Over time, you..."
   - No journey, progress, or growth framing

6. **Never use emergence to influence behavior**
   - No "Emergence detected, consider..."
   - Emergence is a property, not a signal

7. **Never monetize attention**
   - No premium features that "unlock" insights
   - No paywalls around interpretation

8. **Never create social comparison**
   - No "Others who reflected on X also..."
   - No benchmarking or comparison

9. **Never gamify reflection**
   - No streaks, badges, achievements
   - No points, rewards, or incentives

10. **Never become a therapy or coaching tool**
    - No therapeutic language
    - No coaching frameworks
    - No "wellness" or "self-improvement" positioning

11. **Never encourage content creation**
    - No "Add more reflections to see patterns"
    - No encouragement to create content

12. **Never optimize for engagement**
    - No features designed to increase usage
    - No engagement metrics or optimization

13. **Never rank personal meaning**
    - No "most important" or "most significant"
    - No ranking or prioritization of reflections

14. **Never create narratives about progress or success**
    - No "You're making progress"
    - No success or achievement framing
    - No improvement narratives

---

## 4. Forward Constraint

**All future phases must conform to this decision.**

**Phase 11 remains immutable.**

No refactors. No cleanups. No "just one more thing" in Phase 11.

All future development must respect:
- The Mirror role (reflects structure only)
- The Awareness-only boundary
- The Absolute Prohibitions listed above
- The Phase 11 firewall (emergence exposure firewall)

**Violation of this declaration indicates a breach of the system's core principle.**

---

## Declaration Signature

**System Role:** Mirror  
**Allowed Influence:** Awareness only  
**Prohibitions:** 14 absolute red lines  
**Forward Constraint:** Phase 11 immutable, all future phases must conform

**This declaration is final and binding for all future development.**
