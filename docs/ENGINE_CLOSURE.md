# Engine Closure — Rules of Engagement

This document defines the **rules of engagement** for the transition from builder to navigator.

It describes what counts as "engine closed," what must be decided before cockpit work, and how to prevent feature creep.

---

## What Counts as Engine Closed

The engine is closed when:

### No New Insight Types
- All insight types are defined and stable
- No new computation patterns are being added
- The signal engine (Layer 4) is complete

### No New Data Models
- All data structures are defined and stable
- No new tables or schemas are being added
- The encrypted memory layer (Layer 2) is complete

### No New Metaphors
- The cognitive vessel metaphor is locked
- The spaceship cockpit metaphor is structural, not aesthetic
- No new conceptual frameworks are being introduced

### Layers 1-6 Are Stable
- Identity and Trust (Layer 1) is complete
- Encrypted Memory (Layer 2) is complete
- Time and Structure (Layer 3) is complete
- Insight Computation (Layer 4) is complete
- Lens Layer (Layer 5) is mechanically complete
- Sharing and Externalization (Layer 6) is complete

**Engine closure means:** The system can compute insights, organize them across time, and share them. No new computation or data models are needed.

---

## What Must Be Decided Before Cockpit

Before cockpit work begins, these decisions must be made:

### Sharing Rules
- What can be shared (derived insights only)
- What cannot be shared (raw entries)
- How sharing boundaries are enforced
- What the sharing ritual is (not just mechanics)

### Recovery Boundaries
- How data is recovered if lost
- What happens if encryption keys are lost
- How to handle corrupted data
- What the recovery experience is

### Export Guarantees
- What formats are supported
- What data is included in exports
- How exports are structured
- What the export experience is

**Note:** These are **decisions**, not implementations. The cockpit can be built once these decisions are made, even if the implementations are not complete.

---

## Transition Criteria

Engine closure is a transitional state, not a resting state.

Once closure criteria are met, prolonged continuation in builder mode increases the risk of alienation from the system and loss of experiential intimacy.

The cockpit should be built in one focused arc immediately after closure, not deferred indefinitely.

---

## What Is Allowed After Closure

After engine closure, these are allowed:

### Design Choreography
- Motion design that supports the cognitive vessel vision
- Transitions that feel like thought, not productivity
- Spatial hierarchy that supports exploration

### Instrumentation
- UI elements that feel like instruments, not widgets
- Visualizations that support witnessing, not analysis
- Interfaces that feel like a cockpit, not a dashboard

### Motion and Silence
- Animations that imply thought, not action
- Transitions that slow down, not speed up
- Silence that is intentional, not empty

**The key:** All of these must serve the cognitive vessel vision. They are not features; they are articulation of the vision.

---

## How to Prevent Feature Creak

After engine closure, explicitly refuse:

### New Insight Types
- Do not add new computation patterns
- Do not add new signal types
- Do not add new analysis methods

### New Data Models
- Do not add new tables
- Do not add new schemas
- Do not add new data structures

### New Metaphors
- Do not introduce new conceptual frameworks
- Do not add new metaphors
- Do not change the core vision

### Dashboard Patterns
- Do not add feeds
- Do not add card grids
- Do not add metrics-first layouts
- Do not add gamification

### Productivity Patterns
- Do not add task lists
- Do not add reminders
- Do not add notifications
- Do not add urgency

**The rule:** If it is not articulation of the existing vision, it is feature creep.

---

## Definition of Done for Cockpit Work

Cockpit work is done when:

### Experience Aligned with North Star
- Entering the system feels like entering your own mind
- Navigation feels like exploration
- Insights feel discovered, not served
- Time feels dimensional
- Silence feels intentional

### Not Feature Completeness
- Cockpit work is not about adding features
- It is about articulating the existing vision
- It is about making the cognitive vessel feel real
- It is about instrumentation, not functionality

### The System Feels Complete
- The system feels finished, not incomplete
- The experience is coherent, not fragmented
- The vision is realized, not approximated

**The test:** Does entering the system feel like entering your own mind safely? If yes, cockpit work is done.

---

## Transition from Builder to Navigator

Engine closure marks the transition from **builder** to **navigator**.

### Builder Phase
- Focus on layers 1-6
- Build computation and data models
- Establish invariants and constraints
- Lock the vision

### Navigator Phase
- Focus on cockpit and instrumentation
- Articulate the experiential vision
- Design the spatial hierarchy
- Realize the cognitive vessel

**The transition:** Once the engine is closed, the work shifts from building the engine to navigating the vessel.

---

## Reminder

Engine closure is not about feature completeness.

It is about **stability**.

Once the engine is stable, cockpit work can begin.

But cockpit work is not about adding features.

It is about **articulating the vision**.
