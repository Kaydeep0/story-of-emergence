# Personal Modes

Personal modes are attention postures, not visual themes. They change how the vault feels without changing how it looks.

## Mode 1: Observer

**When this mode is used:**
- Reading insights and patterns
- Understanding themes over time
- Reviewing year-over-year comparisons
- Exploring narrative views

**What it emphasizes:**
- Language tone: Observational, neutral, descriptive
- Density of information: Moderate, narrative-first
- Which surfaces feel primary: Insights lens, Lifetime view, Year-over-year comparison
- Reading flow: Vertical scroll, chapter-like presentation
- Evidence over action: Reflection chips open for context, not editing

**What it suppresses:**
- Counts and metrics (already enforced, but mode reinforces)
- Editing controls on insights pages
- Sharing actions (moved to explicit, intentional flows)
- Secondary navigation (Sources, Shared are less prominent)
- Action buttons that imply "do something next"

**What must NOT change:**
- Visual appearance (colors, fonts, spacing remain identical)
- Navigation structure (same routes, same hierarchy)
- Data access (all information remains available)
- Sanctuary invariants (no urgency, no rewards, no gamification)

## Mode 2: Writer

**When this mode is used:**
- Capturing a new reflection
- Writing in the moment
- Recording thoughts as they emerge

**What it emphasizes:**
- Language tone: Inviting, open, non-prescriptive
- Density of information: Minimal, focused on the text area
- Which surfaces feel primary: Reflection editor, draft management
- Writing flow: Single focus, minimal distractions
- Completion signals: Subtle save confirmation, no celebration

**What it suppresses:**
- Navigation tabs (less prominent, not hidden)
- Insight previews (available but not pushed)
- Source linking UI (available but not prominent)
- Sharing prompts (never appears during writing)
- Achievement language ("You've written X reflections" - forbidden)

**What must NOT change:**
- Visual appearance (same baseline, same colors)
- Functionality (all features remain accessible)
- Exit behavior (leaving feels resolved, not addictive)
- Sanctuary invariants (no pressure, no goals, no streaks)

## Mode 3: Reviewer

**When this mode is used:**
- Reading past reflections
- Connecting ideas across time
- Deep reflection on individual entries
- Closing a session

**What it emphasizes:**
- Language tone: Contemplative, patient, non-judgmental
- Density of information: Rich but not overwhelming
- Which surfaces feel primary: Single reflection view, reflection detail drawer
- Reading flow: Slow, deliberate, with breathing room
- Context over action: Related reflections, linked sources, temporal context

**What it suppresses:**
- Editing controls (available but not prominent)
- Sharing actions (moved to explicit flows)
- Navigation urgency (no "next" or "previous" buttons that pressure movement)
- Achievement summaries (no "you've read X reflections today")
- Completion prompts ("Come back tomorrow" - forbidden)

**What must NOT change:**
- Visual appearance (identical to other modes)
- Data integrity (all reflections remain accessible)
- Exit signals (completion feels resolved, not rewarded)
- Sanctuary invariants (no social pressure, no performance framing)

## Implementation Principles

**Modes are silent:**
- No user-facing toggles
- No settings panels
- No mode indicators
- Modes activate based on context (which page, which action)

**Modes are additive:**
- Each mode enhances the baseline
- Modes never remove functionality
- Modes suppress prominence, not access

**Modes respect sanctuary:**
- All sanctuary invariants remain intact
- Visual baseline never changes
- Structural coherence never breaks
- Language tone shifts subtly, never dramatically

**Modes are contextual:**
- Observer mode: Insights pages, narrative views
- Writer mode: Reflection editor, draft creation
- Reviewer mode: Single reflection view, detail drawers

## Why Three Modes

Three is enough. More would create choice pressure. Fewer would miss important attention postures.

- **Observer** = Understanding patterns
- **Writer** = Capturing thoughts
- **Reviewer** = Reflecting deeply

These cover the essential ways someone interacts with their vault. Everything else is variation, not a new mode.
