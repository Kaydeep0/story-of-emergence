# Start of Day Protocol

This protocol anchors work to canonical system memory before any changes are made.

---

## Repository State Check
- Current branch:
- Uncommitted changes:
- Build status: ☐ Passing ☐ Failing ☐ Not evaluated (reason)
- Recent commits reviewed:

---

## Canonical Alignment Check
- Core memory index reviewed: docs/0_START_HERE.md
- Engine state: ☐ Open ☐ Closed ☐ Closing
- Observer layer: Not implemented (by design)
- Cockpit / UI work: ☐ Allowed ☐ Not allowed today (must choose)

Affirmations:
- No new insight types will be added today
- No new data models will be added today
- No new metaphors will be introduced today
- Work today must articulate existing vision, not expand it

---

## Continuity Reminder
The system remembers patterns, tensions, and shifts — not goals, judgments, or prescriptions.

---

## Intent for Today
Describe the *class* of work, not the tasks.
Example: "Stabilization," "Articulation," "Verification," "Cleanup."

---

## Exit Condition
What must be true at the end of today for the work to be considered complete?
