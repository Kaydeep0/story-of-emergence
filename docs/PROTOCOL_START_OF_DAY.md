# Start of Day Protocol

This protocol anchors work to canonical system memory before any changes are made.

---

## Re-Entry Gate

If any of the following are true:
• More than 7 days since last repository activity
• Returning after travel, illness, burnout, or interruption
• Uncertain about current phase, locks, or allowed work
• Handing control to an assistant (Cursor or human)
• Feeling disoriented about what is real vs assumed

Then STOP.

Run `docs/PROTOCOL_REENTRY_AND_PROGRESS.md` in full before continuing.

No code may be written until the Re-Entry Protocol is complete and
`PROGRESS_REPORT.md` exists for the current date.

This makes re-entry structural, not optional.

**What NOT to do**

Do not auto-fill intent or exit conditions.
Those must remain human choices.

The system protects you from drift, not from decision-making.

**Mechanical enforcement (required):**
- Run `./scripts/reentry_guard.sh` before executing this protocol.

## Repository State Check
- Current branch:
- Uncommitted changes:
- Build status: ☐ Passing ☐ Failing ☐ Not evaluated (reason)
- Recent commits reviewed:

---

## Canonical Alignment Check
- Core memory index reviewed: docs/0_START_HERE.md
- Engine state: ☐ Open ☐ Closed ☐ Closing
- Observer layer: Not implemented (by design)
- Cockpit / UI work: ☐ Allowed ☐ Not allowed today (must choose)

Affirmations:
- No new insight types will be added today
- No new data models will be added today
- No new metaphors will be introduced today
- Work today must articulate existing vision, not expand it

---

## Continuity Reminder
The system remembers patterns, tensions, and shifts — not goals, judgments, or prescriptions.

---

## Intent for Today
Describe the *class* of work, not the tasks.
Example: "Stabilization," "Articulation," "Verification," "Cleanup."

---

## Exit Condition
What must be true at the end of today for the work to be considered complete?
