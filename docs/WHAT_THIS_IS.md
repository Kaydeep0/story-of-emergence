# What This Is

Story of Emergence is a private, user owned reflection system.

It stores your entries as ciphertext. Insight computation runs on your device. The server can store data, but it cannot read it.

## What it is
A vault for reflections.
A set of lenses that summarize patterns without interpretation.
A tool for continuity of self across time.

## What it is not
Not a social feed.
Not a therapist.
Not a system that tells you what your life means.

## Privacy guarantee
Your journal text is encrypted client side.
Decryption keys are derived from your wallet signature.
No plaintext is required to store, compute, or share.

## Where to start
Read `docs/0_START_HERE.md` and follow the Start of Day protocol.
