# Start Here

This is the canonical index for Story of Emergence.
Read these documents before proposing changes, especially UI changes.

## Core Laws
1. docs/INVARIANTS.md
2. docs/POSTURE.md
3. docs/SCOPE.md
4. docs/OBSERVATION_BOUNDARIES.md

## Design Contract
4. docs/DESIGN_NORTH_STAR.md
5. docs/OBSERVER_LAYER.md
6. docs/OBSERVER_V0.md (Observer v0 contract — frozen)
7. docs/CONTINUITY_OF_SELF.md

## System Map
7. docs/CORE_STACK.md
8. docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOW.md

## Transition Rules
9. docs/ENGINE_CLOSURE.md
10. docs/ENGINE_CLOSURE_CRITERIA.md

## Not Core Memory
STATUS.md, phase docs, beta docs, cleanup docs, deprecation maps are operational or historical.
They are not laws.
