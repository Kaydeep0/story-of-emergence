## Why Trace Preservation Exists

Story of Emergence is built on the premise that understanding is not defined by the final artifact produced, but by the observer's ability to reconstruct how meaning emerged.

As AI-assisted work accelerates abstraction, users can arrive at coherent insights while losing access to the cognitive path that formed them. This collapse of trace weakens epistemic agency even when output quality improves.

The system therefore treats trace preservation as a first-class concern. Its purpose is not to generate answers, but to preserve the observer's ability to remain inside their own understanding as meaning forms over time.

3. docs/SCOPE.md
4. docs/OBSERVATION_BOUNDARIES.md

## Design Contract
4. docs/DESIGN_NORTH_STAR.md
5. docs/OBSERVER_LAYER.md
6. docs/OBSERVER_V0.md (Observer v0 contract — frozen)
7. docs/CONTINUITY_OF_SELF.md

## System Map

8. docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOW.md

## Transition Rules

## Not Core Memory
STATUS.md, phase docs, beta docs, cleanup docs, deprecation maps are operational or historical.
They are not laws.
