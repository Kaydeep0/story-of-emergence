# Engine Closure Criteria — One Page

**Purpose:** Define what counts as "engine closed" so the transition from builder to navigator can happen at the right time.

## The Engine Is Closed When

### 1. No New Insight Types
- All insight types are defined and stable
- No new computation patterns are being added
- The signal engine (Layer 4) is complete

### 2. No New Data Models
- All data structures are defined and stable
- No new tables or schemas are being added
- The encrypted memory layer (Layer 2) is complete

### 3. No New Metaphors
- The cognitive vessel metaphor is locked
- The spaceship cockpit metaphor is structural, not aesthetic
- No new conceptual frameworks are being introduced

### 4. Layers 1-6 Are Stable
- ✅ Identity and Trust (Layer 1) — Complete
- ✅ Encrypted Memory (Layer 2) — Complete
- ✅ Time and Structure (Layer 3) — Complete
- ✅ Insight Computation (Layer 4) — Complete
- ✅ Lens Layer (Layer 5) — Mechanically complete
- ✅ Sharing and Externalization (Layer 6) — Complete

**Engine closure means:** The system can compute insights, organize them across time, and share them. No new computation or data models are needed.

## What Must Be Decided Before Cockpit

These are **decisions**, not implementations. The cockpit can be built once these decisions are made, even if the implementations are not complete.

### Sharing Rules
- What can be shared (derived insights only)
- What cannot be shared (raw entries)
- How sharing boundaries are enforced
- What the sharing ritual is (not just mechanics)

### Recovery Boundaries
- How data is recovered if lost
- What happens if encryption keys are lost
- How to handle corrupted data
- What the recovery experience is

### Export Guarantees
- What formats are supported
- What data is included in exports
- How exports are structured
- What the export experience is

## Transition Criteria

**Engine closure is a transitional state, not a resting state.**

Once closure criteria are met, prolonged continuation in builder mode increases the risk of alienation from the system and loss of experiential intimacy.

**The cockpit should be built in one focused arc immediately after closure, not deferred indefinitely.**

## What Is Allowed After Closure

### Design Choreography
- Motion design that supports the cognitive vessel vision
- Transitions that feel like thought, not productivity
- Spatial hierarchy that supports exploration

### Instrumentation
- UI elements that feel like instruments, not widgets
- Visualizations that support witnessing, not analysis
- Interfaces that feel like a cockpit, not a dashboard

### Motion and Silence
- Animations that imply thought, not action
- Transitions that slow down, not speed up
- Silence that is intentional, not empty

**The key:** All of these must serve the cognitive vessel vision. They are not features; they are articulation of the vision.

---

## What Is Explicitly Forbidden After Closure

### Feature Creep Prevention
- ❌ New insight types
- ❌ New data models
- ❌ New metaphors
- ❌ Dashboard patterns (feeds, card grids, metrics-first layouts)
- ❌ Productivity patterns (task lists, reminders, notifications, urgency)

**The rule:** If it is not articulation of the existing vision, it is feature creep.

## Definition of Done for Cockpit Work

Cockpit work is done when:

- Entering the system feels like entering your own mind safely
- Navigation feels like exploration
- Insights feel discovered, not served
- Time feels dimensional
- Silence feels intentional

**The test:** Does entering the system feel like entering your own mind safely? If yes, cockpit work is done.

**Note:** Cockpit work is not about feature completeness. It is about articulating the existing vision and making the cognitive vessel feel real.

## The Transition

**Builder Phase:**
- Focus on layers 1-6
- Build computation and data models
- Establish invariants and constraints
- Lock the vision

**Navigator Phase:**
- Focus on cockpit and instrumentation
- Articulate the experiential vision
- Design the spatial hierarchy
- Realize the cognitive vessel

**Once the engine is closed, the work shifts from building the engine to navigating the vessel.**

---

## Reminder

Engine closure is not about feature completeness.

It is about **stability**.

Once the engine is stable, cockpit work can begin.

But cockpit work is not about adding features.

It is about **articulating the vision**.
