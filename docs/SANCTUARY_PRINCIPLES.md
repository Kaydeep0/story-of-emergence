# Sanctuary Principles

This document defines what the vault must feel like, what it must never become, and what remains sacred as the product evolves.

## 1. What is this space not allowed to feel like?

Hard no's:

• **Dashboard** — No metrics, KPIs, or performance indicators. No "at a glance" summaries that imply evaluation.

• **Productivity app** — No task lists, completion tracking, or efficiency optimization. No "get things done" language.

• **Social feed** — No likes, follows, or engagement metrics. No comparison to others. No public performance.

• **Analytics tool** — No charts implying improvement or decline. No trend analysis that suggests optimization. No data visualization that assigns value.

• **Performance tracker** — No streaks, goals, targets, or achievement badges. No "you're doing great" or "keep it up" messaging.

• **To-do list** — No action items, reminders, or completion states. No sense of unfinished work or obligations.

• **Gamified system** — No points, levels, achievements, or progress bars. No rewards or unlockable features.

## 2. What should someone feel after 20 minutes inside their vault?

**Settled** — The space slows you down. There's no rush, no urgency, no pressure to act. You can sit with your thoughts without the interface demanding attention.

**Oriented** — You understand where you are in your own timeline. You see patterns without judgment. The view helps you locate yourself in your own story without telling you what it means.

**Less fragmented** — Your reflections feel connected, not scattered. Themes emerge naturally without forcing synthesis. The space holds your thinking without fragmenting it further.

**Curious** — You want to explore your own patterns, not optimize them. Questions arise from observation, not from the interface suggesting what you should notice.

**Safe** — Nothing feels public or performative. You can be honest with yourself. The vault protects your thinking from external evaluation, including your own self-criticism.

**Clear without urgency** — Insights appear, but they don't demand action. Understanding emerges without pressure to change or improve. Clarity exists for its own sake.

## 3. What elements should change slowly over time, not instantly?

**Visual density** — The interface should feel lighter as you accumulate more reflections. Over months, borders fade, spacing increases, and the view becomes more spacious. This happens gradually, not as a setting.

**Color warmth** — As patterns stabilize and themes persist, subtle warmth can emerge in the palette. This is seasonal, not instantaneous. The space remembers your history and reflects it back gently.

**Language tone** — After years of use, the language can become more familiar and less formal. The system learns your voice and mirrors it back, but this happens over many months of interaction.

**Structural complexity** — New views and connections appear slowly as your data matures. A reflection from year one gains meaning only after year three exists. Complexity emerges from depth, not from features.

**Ritual surfaces** — Certain views become habitual through repeated use. The interface recognizes these patterns and makes them more accessible, but this recognition happens over seasons, not sessions.

## 4. What should always remain invariant?

Sacred constraints that never break:

• **No public comparison** — Your reflections are never compared to others. No "you wrote more than 80% of users" or "most people reflect on X." You exist in your own context only.

• **No scores** — No numeric ratings, rankings, or performance metrics. No "you're in the top 10%" or "your consistency score is 7/10." Numbers exist only as patterns, never as evaluations.

• **No streak pressure** — No consecutive day counters, no "don't break your streak" messaging, no calendar heatmaps implying daily obligation. Time exists as context, not as a goal.

• **No growth language** — No "you've improved" or "you're getting better." No "this year was more productive than last year." Change is observed, not evaluated.

• **No algorithmic manipulation** — No hidden ranking, no "you might also like," no suggestions based on what others do. The system shows what exists, not what it thinks you should see.

• **No urgency** — No "you haven't reflected in 3 days" or "complete your weekly review." The vault waits. It never prompts action.

• **No performative sharing** — Sharing is always opt-in, always intentional, always feels slightly weighty. No default public settings, no auto-sharing, no social pressure.

• **No optimization framing** — No "here's how to write better reflections" or "tips for consistency." The system observes, it never coaches.

• **No gamification** — No achievements, badges, levels, or unlockable features. No progress bars toward goals. No rewards for use.

• **No live links** — Shares are immutable snapshots. They don't update if source data changes. Once sealed, they remain as artifacts, not as windows into your vault.

## Why This Matters

This document anchors all future design decisions:

• **Customization** becomes safe — Themes and layouts can evolve without breaking sanctuary feeling

• **Design decisions** stop being emotional — We judge changes against these principles, not against preferences

• **Features can grow** — New views and capabilities can emerge without losing the core feeling

• **Long-term identity** is protected — As the product evolves, the sanctuary remains intact

Every future change will be evaluated against these principles. If a feature threatens any invariant, it doesn't belong in the vault.
