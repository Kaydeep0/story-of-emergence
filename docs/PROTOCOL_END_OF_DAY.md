# End of Day Protocol

This protocol checks alignment, not productivity.

---

## Work Summary
Facts only. Use short bullets. No justification, no interpretation.
Include:
- Commits made today (count + 3–8 key bullets max)
- Any uncommitted changes (count + file list summary)

---

## Uncommitted Changes Intent
Were uncommitted changes intentionally left open?
☐ Yes ☐ No

If Yes:
- Why were they left uncommitted (1 sentence)
- What is the intended next action (commit, revert, split, abandon)

If No:
- Instruction: either commit, stash, or revert before closing the day

---

## Stance Integrity Check
If there were uncommitted changes, do not evaluate them. State: "Uncommitted changes not evaluated."

- Did any change introduce prescription, optimization, or judgment? ☐ No ☐ Yes
- Did any change imply interpretation rather than witnessing? ☐ No ☐ Yes
- Did any change collapse continuity into conclusions? ☐ No ☐ Yes

---

## Continuity Impact
Did today's changes strengthen the system's ability to remember the user across time?
☐ Strengthened ☐ Neutral ☐ Weakened

Explain briefly.

---

## Drift Check
If I return to this system after a month, would today's changes help it remember me — or confuse it?

---

## Closure
Is the engine still:
☐ Open ☐ Closing ☐ Closed
