# NEXT

## Top priorities

### 1 Raise Threads coverage or make orphans first class
Goal: reduce orphan reflections or clearly explain them in product language.

Deliverables:
A deterministic auto tune path that tries to reach a target coverage
A clear Orphans panel that is helpful, not shameful
Provenance toggle remains available for debugging

### 2 Lock a release marker for Insights v1
Deliverables:
CHANGELOG entry for the completion milestone
One paragraph milestone summary for PR or Notion
Optional git tag for Insights v1

### 3 Harden invariants in code review flow
Deliverables:
A small checklist in PR template referencing `docs/INVARIANTS.md`
At least one quick regression test for deterministic bridge output
