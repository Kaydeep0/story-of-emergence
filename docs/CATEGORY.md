# Category & Shelf Placement

## What this resembles

This resembles a private journal or diary. It stores written entries over time. It allows looking back at what was written. It can be shared selectively with others.

It also resembles encrypted note-taking systems. Content is encrypted before storage. The server never sees plaintext. Access requires a key derived from a wallet signature.

## What this is different from

This is different from productivity tools. It does not track habits, set goals, or measure progress. It does not optimize behavior or suggest improvements.

This is different from AI assistants. It does not generate text, offer suggestions, or analyze writing. It does not claim to understand patterns or themes.

This is different from social networks. Sharing is explicit, one-to-one, and encrypted. There are no feeds, followers, or public profiles.

## What problem space it occupies

This occupies the space of private writing without surveillance. Some people want to write without platforms reading everything. Some want to look back without being told what to think. Some want to share selectively without exposing content to intermediaries.

## What problem space it avoids

This avoids the problem space of productivity and optimization. It does not help users become more efficient, achieve goals, or improve themselves.

This avoids the problem space of insight generation. It does not claim to know what patterns matter, what themes are important, or what users should do.

This avoids the problem space of social connection. It is not designed for building networks, finding community, or public expression.

## Public-facing category line

This is a private, encrypted reflection system.
