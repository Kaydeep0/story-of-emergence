# Visual Governance

## Section 1: Purpose of Visuals

Visuals exist to support perception, not judgment. They provide texture and context for narrative understanding without imposing meaning or evaluation.

Visuals are secondary to narrative. Text and language carry meaning; visuals provide perceptual support. When visuals and narrative conflict, narrative takes precedence.

Visuals must never imply success, failure, improvement, or decline. They show what is present, what is absent, and how things are distributed—not whether those distributions are good or bad.

## Section 2: Allowed Visual Types

The following visual categories are permitted:

• Distribution clouds — point dispersions showing how values cluster or spread

• Contrast textures — visual comparisons between two time slices or states

• Temporal density patterns — representations of activity or presence over time

• Presence or absence indicators — simple markers showing what exists and what does not

No other visual types are permitted unless this document is explicitly amended.

## Section 3: Forbidden Visual Semantics

The following semantic elements are explicitly banned:

• Scores — numeric or symbolic representations of performance or quality

• Rankings — ordered lists implying better or worse

• Progress bars — indicators suggesting advancement or completion

• Percent changes — comparisons framed as improvement or decline

• Averages, trendlines, or forecasts — aggregations that imply directionality or prediction

• Green/red success signaling — color coding that assigns value to outcomes

• "Growth", "improvement", "performance", "optimization" language — words that frame change as positive or negative

## Section 4: Interaction Rules

Visuals must adhere to the following interaction constraints:

• No hover explanations that add meaning — tooltips must not introduce interpretation or judgment

• No tooltips that introduce interpretation — if a visual requires explanation, it should be removed rather than explained

• No animations implying directionality — motion must not suggest progress, growth, or decline

• No gamified affordances — visual elements must not resemble game mechanics, achievements, or rewards

• Visuals must remain legible if screenshotted — static captures must convey the same perceptual information as the live view

## Section 5: Enforcement Principle

Any visual that requires explanation should be removed. If a user cannot understand what they are seeing without additional context, the visual has failed its purpose. Narrative always has veto power over visuals—when in doubt, remove the visual and rely on language. Silence is preferable to misleading clarity. A missing visual is better than a visual that implies meaning that does not exist.
